# Lintalist4Linux

Linux and Windows -platform Text Replacer/Adder/Scripter written in AutoKey/Phyton and AutoHotKey with the Help from Lintalist  

## How it works

Lintalist4Linux
 
1. waits for shortcut (recommended Ctrl+K or simple F12)
1. reads your word as keyword (for example `:date` , `:now` or `now` or `address` etc.)
    1. replace your word
        1. for example `:date` and replaces it with 20.08.2020 
        1. for example `:now` and replaces it with 20.08.2020 16:48:24 
    1. adds new line behind your word
        1. for example `now` adds the result into a new line. for e.g. 20.08.2020 16:48:24 and selects this line 
1. If you want many for one keyword the Lintalist-Menu â‡¶ is opening (see more in Lintalist-Configuration about AutoExecuteOnce)
3. Also you have the result in your clipboard.

https://lintalist.github.io/ says (10.08.2020):
"Lintalist allows you to store and (incrementally) search <br>
and edit texts in bundles and paste a selected text in your active program.<br>
... Lintalist is open source and developed in AutoHotkey ..."

Tested with LinuxMint Version 20now

# installation (recommended):
- LinuxMint (new versions) or maybe other Linux
- wine (may use your Software Manager)
- Winetricks (maybe not needet) (may use your Software Manager)
- AutoKey (may use your Software Manager)
- AutoHotKey
- Lintalist

copy <br>
run-run-run-lintalistAHK.py 
to <br>
/home/ YOU /.config/autokey/data/Sample Scripts/

# recommended Preferences:

edit one line of each file (so they find your scripts) 

## Autokey - Preferences:
- enable: Automatically start Autokey at login
- Set a Hotkey in that py-File 

## Lintalist - Settings:
- QuickSearchHotkey: F1 (needed reflected inside run-lintalistAHK.ahk)<br>
You find QuickSearchHotkey nearly at the last page inside this long list into the 'Lintalist - Settings'
- PasteMethod s recommended (you find it in the middle of the long settings list):
    - 1=Paste snippet and keep it as the current clipboard content (so you can manually paste it again)
    - 2=Don't paste snippet content but copy it to the clipboard so you can manually paste it.
- BTW i like the SearchMethod 2=Fuzzy (you find it in the middle)

- use part 3 sometimes: don't use part 2 use part 3 for Script and run part 3 using Shift+Enter
    - Example: field 1: now , field 2: clipboard := a_now

Or:    
<pre>
FormatTime, timestampyyMMddHHmmss , %A_now%,yyMMddHHmmss
FormatTime, timestampyyMMddHHmmssPretty, %A_now%,yy:MM:dd HH:mm:ss
clipboard := timestampyyMMddHHmmssPretty
</pre>
    
- AutoExecuteOnce: 2 
<pre>
Default: 0
If only one result is left during the search AutoExecute (no need to press enter)
0=No
1=Yes, use part 1 (or run script)
2=Yes, use part 2 (or run script)
</pre>
