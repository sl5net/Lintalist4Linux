# Lintalist4Linux
shortcut in linux should run the Lintalist-Menu and give the result in a way (may clipboard)

last days i installed https://lintalist.github.io/ and tried use it in linx.

Tested with LinuxMint Version 20

# installation (recommended):
- LinuxMint (new versions) or maybe other Linux
- wine
- winetricks (maybe not needet)
- AutoKey
- AutoHotKey
- Lintalist

copy <br>
run-run-run-lintalistAHK.py 
to <br>
/home/ YOU /.config/autokey/data/Sample Scripts/

# recommended Preferences:

edit one line of each file (so they find your scripts) 

## Autokey - Preferences:
- enable: Automatically start Autokey at login
- Set a Hotkey in that py-File 

## Lintalist - Settings:
QuickSearchHotkey: F1 (needed reflected inside run-lintalistAHK.ahk)
You find QuickSearchHotkey nearly at the last page inside this long list into the 'Lintalist - Settings'
