That line cd ~/ahk/github, try changing it to follow the original cd ~/ahk/github/ and see if it works now. – Vlam 6 hours ago

You are messing up things for yourself by using sudo on things which do not require privileges. Downloading a file to your own downloads folder should absolutely not be done as root; then you also won't need to sudo chmod (or, eventually, sudo rm if you want to remove the file). – tripleee 42 mins ago
